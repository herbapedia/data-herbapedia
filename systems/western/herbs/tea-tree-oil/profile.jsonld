    "en": "Tea Tree oil comes from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia, a species native to the northeast coast of New South Wales in Australia. It is considered one of the most important natural antiseptics, and can be used to treat stings, burns, wounds and skin infections of all kinds. Tea Tree oil is strongly antiseptic, diaphoretic and expectorant. It can stimulate the immune system, reduce histamine-induced skin inflammation and is effective against a broad range of bacterial and fungal infections. It is used externally in the treatment of thrush, acne, athlete's foot, verrucae, warts, insect bites, cold sores and nits.\n",
