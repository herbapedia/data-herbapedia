    "en": "Methionine is an amino acid that assists in the breakdown of fats and thereby prevents a build-up of fat in the arteries. It also assists with the digestive system and removing heavy metals from the body since it can be converted to cysteine, a precursor to gluthione, which is of prime importance in detoxifying the liver. Methionine is also a great antioxidant as the sulphur it supplies inactivates free radicals.\n",
