  "westernTraditionalUsage": {
    "en": "The bitter compounds in the leaves and root of the dandelion plant help to stimulate digestion and have a mild laxative effect. They also increase bile production in the gall bladder and bile flow from the liver, making dandelion a useful tonic for people with sluggish liver function due to alcohol abuse or a poor diet. The increase in bile flow can also help improve the body's metabolism of fat (including cholesterol). In Chinese medicine terms, dandelion is considered to be a bitter, cool herb that enters the liver, stomach and bladder meridians to clear heat and drain dampness.\n",
    "zh-Hant": "蒲公英葉子中苦的物質和根部能刺激消化和有輕度通便的效果。它們也能增加膽汁生產，促進膽汁流到肝臟，故對因酗酒或飲食欠佳而導致肝臟功能緩慢者有所幫助。當膽汁流到肝臟的份量有所增加，便可促進身體脂肪（包括膽固醇）的新陳代謝。\n",
