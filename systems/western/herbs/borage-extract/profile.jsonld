    "en": "Borage, also known as starflower, is grown across Europe, north Africa and Iran. It is used as a diuretic, a demulcent and emollient as well as being prized for its culinary uses. Borage is also sometimes used to alleviate and heal colds, bronchitis, and respiratory infections because of its anti-inflammatory and balsamic properties. In France it is used to treat fevers and pulmonary complaints. Externally, it is useful as a poultice for inflammatory swellings.\n",
