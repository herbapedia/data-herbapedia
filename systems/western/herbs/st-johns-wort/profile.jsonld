    "en": "St John's Wort contains a combination of bioactive ingredients, including hypericin, that appear to boost levels of chemicals in the brain that affect mood, making it an effective antidepressant for cases of mild to moderate depression. As a relaxant, it may also improve concentration powers, memory and receptivity without causing drowsiness. People taking St John's Wort should be aware that it can affect the efficacy of the contraceptive pill and make the skin more susceptible to sun sensitivity, and should not be taken if you have already been prescribed antidepressant medication.\n",
