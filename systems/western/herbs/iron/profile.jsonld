    "en": "Iron combines with protein to make haemoglobin, the iron-containing compound in red blood cells that transports oxygen around the body. Iron is also stored in the muscles, so it can supply the oxygen need to make them contract. In addition, it is a component of enzymes which are involved in energy metabolism. Iron deficiency is the most common type of dietary deficiency worldwide, resulting in anaemia, which is characterised by pale skin, weakness, shortness of breath and dizziness.\n",
