    "en": "Ceramides are bioactive molecules in the skin's epidermis. They form a barrier, protecting against water loss and blocking pollutants, and thus play a key role in keeping skin young and healthy looking. However, with age and environmental exposure, ceramides may be lost, resulting in dryness, fine lines and a rough complexion. Ceramides are a key ingredient in anti-aging and other high-tech beauty creams.\n",
