    "en": "Blueberries are one of nature's most abundant source of antioxidants, including the potent substance anthocyanin. Anthocyanin, which comes from the Greek words for plant and blue, gives the berries their dark blue colour. Anthocyanins have been shown in tests to specifically target destructive free radicals that affect age-related mental deterioration and eye problems such as macular degeneration, night blindness and vision complications from diabetes. Anthocyanins also have other benefits for the vision, as they can moisturise the eyes, help improve blood circulation, relieve conjunctival redness and treat dark circles around the eyes.\n",
