    "en": "Niacin is also known as nicotinic acid, or vitamin B3. For the normal functioning of the body, niacin works alongside other B vitamins to help release energy from food, promote healthy nervous and digestive systems, eye health, and keep the skin clear. Nicotinic acid, when taken in quantity, is able to lower bad cholesterol levels and help prevent heart attacks. Niacinamide is the amide of nicotinic acid. It is a constituent of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are coenzymes involved in glycogenolysis, tissue respiration and lipid metabolism.
