  "tcmModernResearch": {
    "en": "Schisandra berries are particularly high in antioxidants, substances which scavenge free radicals and prevent damage to cells that can cause certain diseases and premature ageing. In addition, schisandra contains at least 30 different lignans. Lignans are known to have liver-protective properties and to regenerate damaged liver tissue. Lignans also interfere with a compound called platelet activating factor, which promotes inflammation.\n",
