  "tcmTraditionalUsage": {
    "en": "Lingzhi is reputed to have many medicinal properties: it nourishes the heart and blood; pacifies the spirit; tonifies the chi; relieves coughing symptoms and supports weak digestion. Sweet and neutral in nature, it is suitable for all constitutions and has conventionally been consumed as a general tonic for health maintenance. Its specific applications include deficiency fatigue and insomnia, etc. The spores of the mushroom have particularly strong therapeutic effects as compared to the fruiting body; however, the outer casing of the spores is tough and indigestible, so must be cracked using advanced nanotechnology before coating them immediately to prevent oxidation and preserve the active chemicals.\n",
    "zh-Hant": "味甘、微苦，藥性平和，主要功能是補中益氣，養心安神，用於虛勞羸弱、食慾不振、心悸怔仲、失眠健忘以及咳痰喘息，久嗽不止。現還用於促進心腦血管系統健康，以及改善神經衰弱、慢性呼吸系統毛病等。\n",
