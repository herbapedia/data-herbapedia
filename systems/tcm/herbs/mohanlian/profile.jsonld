    "en": "Mohanlian, made from the Eclipta, or false daisy plant, is sweet and sour tasting and cold in nature. It enters the body's liver and kidney meridians to nourish the yin and tonify the kidneys. Since the liver is associated with the eyes and the kidneys with hair health, this herb can improve symptoms including blurred vision and prematurely grey hair. It can also cool the blood and stop bleeding, and is considered to be a powerful liver tonic.\n",
