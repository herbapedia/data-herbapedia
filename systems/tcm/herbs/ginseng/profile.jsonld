  "tcmHistory": {
    "en": "Ginseng first appeared in the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica. The species Panax ginseng is thought to have been discovered over 5,000 years ago in the mountains of Manchuria, China. Although probably originally used as food, it quickly became revered for its strength-giving and rejuvenating powers and became an important trade item with neighbouring countries. It is prized for restoring harmony and balance to body: a concept understood in Chinese medicine as Yin Yang Theory. Western medicine looks upon ginseng as an adaptogen, a modern term which essentially means the same thing: restoring natural balance to the body.\n",

  "tcmTraditionalUsage": {
    "en": "Ginseng, known in Chinese as renshen, meaning \"man's root\", is one of the most well-known traditional Asian medicines. It is named after its roots, which often grow into the shape of a human form. This herb is sweet, bitter and slightly warm. It enters the lung and spleen meridians, where it tonifies the yuan chi (the source of the body's chi); benefits the spleen, lungs, chi and blood; promotes the generation of body fluids; calms the spirit and improves mental functions. Ginseng is the best herb to strengthen the body and restore vitality. It can also treat deficiencies of the middle jiao characterised by fatigue, lack of energy, nausea and a sallow complexion; and lung deficiencies that are characterised by breathing problems. It is also recommended for improving memory, overcoming confusion and forgetfulness, insomnia, headaches and excessive worrying.\n",

    "en": "Ginseng contains active chemical components called ginsenosides or panaxosides. It is thought to be an adaptogen, meaning that it adapts itself as necessary to treat imbalances in the body. It has been shown to benefit pressure, sugar, triglyceride levels in both men and women. Some studies have also indicated possible beneficial effects on immune function.\n",
