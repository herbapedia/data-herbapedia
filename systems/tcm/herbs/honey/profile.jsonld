  "tcmTraditionalUsage": {
    "en": "According to Chinese traditional medicine, honey is sweet and neutral in nature, entering the spleen and large intestine meridians and tonifying both associated organs, relieving pain and increasing appetite, as well as treating constipation. It also enters the lung meridian and moistens the lungs to stop coughing. Western medicine also prizes honey for its antiseptic and antibacterial properties, and it has long been used both as a topical treatment for skin ailments and taken internally to relieve sore throats and coughing. The antibacterial properties of honey are the result of the combined effects of low water activity causing osmosis, the presence of hydrogen peroxide and high acidity.\n",
