    "en": "Found in rice bran, wheat bran, sunflower seeds, avocados, bananas, corn, fish, kidney, lean meat, liver, nuts, poultry, rice (brown), soybeans and whole grains. Pyridoxine hydrochloride is the most commonly available synthetic form. Yeast (such as brewer's yeast), rice polish, and wheat germ are used as natural source supplements. As vitamin B6 is limited in many foods, supplemental B6 with synthetic pyridoxine hydrochloride may be indicated, especially for infants and during pregnancy and lactation, since processing and cooking foods may destroy up to 50 per cent of its vitamin B6 content.\n",
